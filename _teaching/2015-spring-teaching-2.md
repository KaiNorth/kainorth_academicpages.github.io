We	will	explore	the	relationship between	language	and	technology	from	the invention	of	writing	systems	to	current	natural	language	and	speech technologies.	Topics	include	script	decipherment,	machine	translation, automatic	speech	recognition	and	generation,	dialog	systems,	computational	natural	language	understanding	and	inference,	as	well	as	language technologies	that	support	users	with	disabilities.	We	will	also	trace how	science	and	technology	are	shaping	language,	discuss	relevant	artificial intelligence	concepts,	and	examine	the	ethical	implications	of	advances	in language	processing	by	computers.	Students	will	have the	opportunity	to experience	text	analysis	with	a	programming	language	and	speech	analysis.
