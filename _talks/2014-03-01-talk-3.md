Identifying complex words in texts is an important first step in text simplification (TS) systems. We investigate the performance of binary comparative Lexical Complexity Prediction (LCP) models applied to a popular benchmark dataset --- the CompLex 2.0 dataset used in SemEval-2021 Task 1. With the data from CompLex 2.0, we create a new dataset contain 1,940 sentences referred to as CompLex-BC. Using CompLex-BC, we train multiple models to differentiate which of two target words is more or less complex in the same sentence. A linear SVM model achieved the best performance in our experiments with an F1-score of 0.86.
