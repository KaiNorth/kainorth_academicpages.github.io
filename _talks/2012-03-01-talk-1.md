This talk briefly introduces RIT's entry into two shared-tasks hosted at SemEval 2021 and FIRE 2021 respectively: the Lexical Complexity Prediction (LCP) Shared Task and the Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in English and Indo-Aryan Languages (HASOC) Shared Task. This talk will also discuss my future research into target-based offensive language identification and its possible utilization within security applications.
