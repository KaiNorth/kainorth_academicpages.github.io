I am a 3rd year Information Technology Ph.D. student at George Mason University, Virginia, USA. I am under the supervision of [Prof. Marcos Zampieri](https://mzampieri.com/). Over the past two years, I have worked at the Language Technology Lab at Rochester Institute of Technology. Here, I have hosted many NLP workshops and lectures ([Click here to watch workshop recording](https://kainorth.netlify.app/portfolio/portfolio-1/)) and have published multiple papers in top-tier conferences and journals.

Research Interests
======
My research interests are in computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) focusing on hate speech detection, language variety identification, text simplification as well as many other NLP-related tasks.

I work on the development of text to token classifiers, multilingual and transfer learning, as well as state-of-the-art machine learning models, including transformers and ensemble-based models.
