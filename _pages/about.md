I am a 4th year Information Technology Ph.D. student at George Mason University, Virginia, USA. I am under the supervision of [Prof. Marcos Zampieri](https://mzampieri.com/).

Over the past two years, I have worked at the Language Technology Lab. Here, I have hosted many NLP workshops and lectures and have published multiple papers in top-tier conferences and journals.

Research Interests
======
My research interests are in computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) focusing on educational technology, online assessment, text simplification as well as many other NLP-related tasks, such as offensive language detection and language variety identification.

I work on the development of text to token classifiers, multilingual and transfer learning, as well as state-of-the-art machine learning models, including transformers, ensemble-based models and prompt learning.
