I am a 3rd year Information Technology Ph.D. student at George Mason University, Virginia, USA. I am under the supervision of [Prof. Marcos Zampieri](https://mzampieri.com/).

Research Interests
======
My research interests are in computational linguistics and natural language processing focusing on hate speech detection, language variety identification, and text simplification.

I work on the development of text to token classifiers, multilingual and transfer learning, as well as state-of-the-art machine learning models, including transformers and ensemble-based models.
