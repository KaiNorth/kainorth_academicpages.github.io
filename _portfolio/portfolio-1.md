title: "Intro to NLP: String Similarity, Edit Distance & Evaluation"
excerpt: "This lab session will teach you how to gauge string similarity by calculating the minimum edit distance between strings (Exercise 1). You will also be introduced to a variety of evaluation metrics: precision, recall, F-score (F1-score), and accuracy, that are used to determine the performance of various NLP and ML algorithms, such as text classifiers (Exercise 2). <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qllt27_Golg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
