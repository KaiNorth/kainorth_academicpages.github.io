This lab session will teach you how to gauge string similarity by calculating the minimum edit distance between strings (Exercise 1). You will also be introduced to a variety of evaluation metrics: precision, recall, F-score (F1-score), and accuracy, that are used to determine the performance of various NLP and ML algorithms, such as text classifiers (Exercise 2).
